# atl-local-news

Create an app that accomplishes the following:

Whenever a user visits this site, the app scrapes stories from a news outlet and displays them for the user. On the back end, each scraped article is saved to the app's database. The app displays the following information:

Headline - the title of the article

Summary - a short summary of the article

URL - the url to the original article

Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

Users are also able to leave comments on the articles displayed and are able to revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and are associated with their articles. Users are also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user (use your language cautiously!).
